- Create a replica of https://botler.ai/en/citizens in 2 hours using React.JS and Material UI

- Two hours were marked on the timeline by my commit: "complete at 2:18pm CDT - 2 hours"

- Though I did not accomplish all the target goals of this challenge within the 2-hour time limit as I hoped for, I found it very exciting and fun, especially since it allowed me to practice real-life skills instead of just answering multiple choice questions or taking a theory test. 

- Therefore, in order to increase my knowledge of a real-life project through practice and to satisfy my curiosity; 
I've decided to continue working to complete this challenge 100% after the two-hours mark using different branches
